# Mobile Experience

## Order of operations

1. Read `BRIEF.md` for platform targets and framework.
2. Read `frilo-design-system/PATTERNS.md` → Mobile experiences section. Those rules are binding.
3. Components per ui-components skill; mobile variants from the inventory (bottom sheet not modal, tab bar not sidebar).

## Rules beyond patterns.md

- Design at 390px width, verify at 320 and 430.
- Primary CTA lives in the bottom third; destructive actions never adjacent to primary ones.
- Lists virtualize past 50 items; every list ships skeleton, empty, and error states.
- Forms: one column, `inputmode` set correctly, autofocus first field only when the screen exists solely for that form.
- Sticky elements account for keyboard: bottom CTAs move above the keyboard or hide.
- Text inputs at type `base` (16) minimum; smaller invites iOS zoom.
- No hover-dependent behavior. Every hover affordance needs a touch equivalent.

## Navigation

- 5 tabs max, active state accent.base, labels always visible
- Deep screens: back affordance top-left AND swipe-back respected
- Modal flows (checkout, onboarding) get an explicit close, top-right

## Checklist before shipping a screen

Safe areas, keyboard behavior, 44px targets, reduced motion, offline/error state, dark background actually `bg.base` and not #000. Then run `ship-check` — this list is what to build toward, that skill is what actually verifies the code still does.
